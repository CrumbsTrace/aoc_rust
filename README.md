This project contains all my (rust) solutions for Advent of Code.
Each year is kept under a total of 1 second total runtime to force me not to go for easy bruteforce solutions

For now these benchmarks are run on my server:
CPU: Ryzen 5 5600G (6 core / 12 threads)
RAM: 32 GB 3200Mhz 

|      | Runtime |
|------|---------|
| 2015 | 608 ms  |
| 2023 | 267 ms  |
